# El Sistema
Evolving L-Systems

Try it [here](https://gvisco.github.io/ElSistema/). Click to create new points and see the L-System evolving to get closer to them.

## What is that?
According to [Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/L-system)
> An L-system consists of an alphabet of symbols that can be used to make strings, a collection of production rules that expand each symbol into some larger string of symbols, an initial "axiom" string from which to begin construction, and a mechanism for translating the generated strings into geometric structures.

Roughly speaking, L-Systems are a clever and very interesting way to generate geometric structures that look like trees.

The idea behind _El Sistema_ is to appy a [genetic algorithm](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Genetic_algorithm) to generate an L-System with special characteristics:
* Minimize the sum of the distances between the the generated tree and a set of points (in a bi-dimensional space)
* Minimize the number of nodes in the generated tree
* Minimize the length of the string generated by the L-System
